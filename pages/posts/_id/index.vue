          Rembrandt never went abroad, but he was considerably influenced by the
          work of the Italian masters and Netherlandish artists who had studied
          in Italy, like Pieter Lastman, the Utrecht Caravaggists, and Flemish
          Baroque Peter Paul Rubens. After he achieved youthful success as a
          portrait painter, Rembrandt's later years were marked by personal
          tragedy and financial hardships. Yet his etchings and paintings were
          popular throughout his lifetime, his reputation as an artist remained
          high,[5] and for twenty years he taught many important Dutch painters.
